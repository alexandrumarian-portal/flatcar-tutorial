# Hands-on 3: deploying

Hello, the goal here is to:
* deploy Flatcar instances with IaC (Terraform)
* manipulate Terraform code
* write Flatcar provisioning with Terraform
* deploy Flatcar on OpenStack with Terraform

This is a bundle of hands-on-1 and hands-on-2 but it's not locally now and we write _everything_ as code.

# Resources

* https://github.com/flatcar/flatcar-terraform/ (NOTE: the terraform code used here is based on this repository)
* https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/openstack/

# Demo
